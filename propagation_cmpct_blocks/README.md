An example of measuring compact blocks when transactions are flooded through 8 links and there are 2 extra blocks-only links:
```
./main.py flood 8 2 0 
```

Connectivity data and tx missing data is gathered via [transaction relay simulator](https://github.com/naumenkogs/Bitcoin-Simulator/tree/compact_blocks_measurement).
